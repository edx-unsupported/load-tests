Deprecation Notice
==================

This private repository, as a place for edx load tests, is being phased out in
favor of the public edx/edx-load-tests_ repo.

.. _edx-load-tests: https://github.com/edx/edx-load-tests/


The ``old-tests`` branch remains as a pointer to the state of edx load tests
immediately before the move to edx/edx-load-tests_.  Instead of modifying or
amending code on the ``old-tests`` branch, you are strongly encouraged instead
to move that code to the public repo and continue your work there.

The ``master`` branch is now used for for dumping raw test data, processed
results, ipython notebooks, and other files which are specific to individual
load test runs.
